# Exercise:
s = "Strings are awesome!"
# Length should be 20
print("Length of s = %d" % len(s))

# First occurrence of "a" should be at index 8
print("The first occurrence of the letter a = %d" % s.index("a"))

# Number of a's should be 2
print("a occurs %d times" % s.count("a"))

# Slicing the string into bits
print("The first five characters are '%s'" % s[:5]) # Start to 5
print("The next five characters are '%s'" % s[5:10]) # 5 to 10
